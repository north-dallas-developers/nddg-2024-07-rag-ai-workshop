# {{ title }}

We'll go from New Project to deploying the application to your phone. MAUI is the latest from Microsoft in multi-platform applications that allows for deploying your device on mobile-to-desktop simultaneously using a single codebase. This is the next evolution of Xamarin.Forms and uses C# on the .NET 6 Framework. Whether you already know C# and want to learn how to write mobile applications or wanting to break into mobile development, this is the session for you.

**Prerequisites:**

* Visual Studio 2022 17.3 (for Windows) or Visual Studio 2022 for Mac 17.3
* Installation: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
* You must select ".NET Multi-platform App UI development" when installing.

**NOTE**: This meeting is in-person. Also, [Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
