There are useful shortcuts using Windows Key, knowing them is a start. As a developer, there are benefits of integrating Machine Learning into your Windows Apps, knowing them is a start.

In this session we will look into how Windows Machine Learning can transform applications by adding the power of artificial intelligence and running it on devices taking full advantage of hardware acceleration. We will walk thru and learn how to train an image classification model with ML.NET Model Builder and inference with Windows Machine Learning.
