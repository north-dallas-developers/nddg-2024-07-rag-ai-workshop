# {{ title }}

Blazor is an enabling new programming model for applications with C# and .NET. Blazor brings
stateful application models to the web and to web-delivered scenarios. From delivering Blazor
apps to production and operating them at increasing scale, Clear Measure has curated some
important architecture patterns that empower developers to move fast, deliver consistent
quality, and run the application with confidence. This presentation assumes the attendee is
already familiar with Blazor and available quick starts of these rules or break them, you will
continually struggle to achieve no-touch, no-drama software deployments.

**NOTE**: This meeting is in-person. Also, [Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
