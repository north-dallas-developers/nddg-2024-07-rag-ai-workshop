The Oculus Quest was one of the best selling hardware devices of 2021. The trend continues in 2022 with billions of dollars being invested towards pushing the limits of augmented/virtual reality tech.

Amir will explain the underlying machinery that powers VR, and show you how can easily make your own VR apps and games.

**NOTE**: This is an in-person event and [Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza. Pizza starts at 6:00. Amir will start at 6:30!
