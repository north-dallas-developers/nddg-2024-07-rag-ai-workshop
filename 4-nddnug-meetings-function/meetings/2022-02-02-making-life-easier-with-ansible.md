<p>Regardless of your role in the our industry it's likely that you have controlled, configured, updated, or deployed something on a machine. It could be a 36 node cluster, a home lab, or your personal laptop. I have put Ansible to the test in all of these environments and it continues to be a staple for me. I'll show you how Ansible makes my life easier in all of these environments by giving me an idempotent set of instructions that I can repeat any time.</p>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>

<p>My name is Brett Jones, I'm a Staff Engineer on the Architecture squad at <a title="invisionapp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.invisionapp.com">InVision</a>. On the internet I go by blockloop. I sort-of fell into this industry when started writing software in 2007 to make my life easier. As time went on my personal solutions became desirable solutions for more and more people. I believe that solutions to problems should be concise. They should provide options to solve problems by shrinking the burdens between the users and their desired outcomes. When I am not on a computer I spend time with my wife and two kids. I have a moderate whiskey collection. I have a private and elaborate IoT network at home with over 50 automations. I like to learn philosophy, read, play competitive basketball, and hang out by the pool.</p>
