title: Event Driven Microservices with Dapr

# {{ title }}

The promise of microservices is to enable teams to build large, complex systems with services that can be deployed as independent units. However, there are several common pitfalls that can introduce coupling among services. Among these are: failing to scope services at the appropriate level of granularity, sharing a database among services, and point-to-point communication between services.

In this workshop Tony will discuss how using Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime @ [https://dapr.io](https://dapr.io)) with an event bus abstraction can address some of these issues, enabling you to build loosely coupled microservices that can be independently developed, deployed and scaled.

Note that this is an in-person event. Pizza will arrive at 6:00 and the presentation will start at 6:30. Please RSVP so [Improving](https://improving.com/) knows how much pizza to purchase for us.
